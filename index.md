The contributions posted here are intended for ESP32-Arduino users and developers.

First contribution:
  RMT-RC (RMT Radio Code), an interactive Sketch to send, receive and decode 24 bits radio codes, usually used in remote controls in the ISM RF band.
  It was built using the hal-rmt-api, the RC-Switch(c) library, and FreeRTOS+CLI as the platform for the cli.
